# Korolev.dk
[Korolev.dk](https://korolev.dk) is my personal website and (more likely) my personal playground. It is under construction for now and uses:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) for views.
- [Stapp](https://stapp.js.org) for managing application state and logic.
